# My Stock App

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.0.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## TODOS:
- Create a home page
- Modal or component for each coin that pulls up more specific stats
- Search functionality?
- New favicon
- more styling overall
- Interfaces for Coin/Details/Exchanges (pipe/map responses)
- Finalize coin-details component
- Figure out better way to display coin detail paragraph (INNERHTML)
